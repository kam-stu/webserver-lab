# webserver-lab

If this is the first time you are attempting to run this website, make sure you install all dependencies by running:
```
npm install
```

If you do not have npm installed, you can do so by installing the npm package:
```
sudo apt/dnf install npm
```

In order to run the backend, navigate to the root directory of this repo and run:
(the root directory is where server.js is located)
```
npm start
```

For testing purposes, instead, run:
```
npm run dev
```

Running this will result in a response from the backend that says:
```
Server is listening on http://localhost:3000
```

Navigate to that URL to see the contents of index.html
